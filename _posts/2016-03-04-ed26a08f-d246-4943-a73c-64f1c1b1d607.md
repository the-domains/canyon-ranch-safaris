The Rush family has owned Farm Gaibis and Farm Quaggasnek since the early 1980's and has always been focused on game conservation and development in Namibia, southwest Africa.  Both farms form one ranch of 90,000 acres, more than ten times larger than most game farms. 

We estimate that the farm has over 15,000 animals available for hunting.

It also borders the Fish River Canyon, the second largest canyon in the world, which is also part of the largest land conservancy in the world.      

The ranch is located just outside of the Kalahari Desert and the Namib Desert, in a semi-desert region known as the Nama Karoo.  It is sparsely vegetated and one of the least populated areas of the world.  The climate is dry and pleasant year-round, with the rainy season in the summer from November to April.  January and February are hot, when daytime temperatures can exceed 104ÂºF, but nights are usually cool and relaxing.  Winter months (June, July, August) are generally warm and quite nice while nights are fairly cold.

Namibia is known as a year-round destination, so please pack accordingly.
